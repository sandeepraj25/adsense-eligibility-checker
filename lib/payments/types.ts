/**
 * One shape for three gateways that agree on almost nothing.
 *
 * Razorpay takes paise and signs `order|payment` with the API secret.
 * Cashfree takes rupees, issues a payment session and verifies by reading
 * the order back. PayPal takes dollars, needs an OAuth token first and
 * verifies webhooks by calling its own verification endpoint. Rather than
 * pretend those are the same thing, each adapter implements this contract
 * and keeps its own strangeness inside.
 *
 * Three rules hold for every adapter:
 *
 *  1. The amount charged comes from our plan record. An adapter converts
 *     units but never decides a price.
 *  2. `verifyReturn` must not trust anything the browser says. It either
 *     checks a signature made with a secret the browser cannot have, or it
 *     asks the gateway directly. "The frontend said it worked" is not a
 *     verification.
 *  3. Nothing here may be imported from a client component. The secrets
 *     live in this module's closure and must stay server-side.
