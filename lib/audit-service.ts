/**
 * One gate, one quota deduction, one report.
 *
 * Both the API route and the dashboard action call this, so the
 * entitlement rules cannot drift between them. The order of the checks
 * matters: the user should be told the most specific true thing —
 * "your account is suspended" before "your plan expired" before "you are
 * out of scans this month".
 *
 * Two things happen before a scan is charged for. The target is parsed and
 * DNS-resolved, so an unreachable or internal address costs nothing; and
 * earlier failures on the same site are pruned, so a person who mistyped a
 * domain four times does not end up with four identical rows in their
 * history burying the reports that worked.
