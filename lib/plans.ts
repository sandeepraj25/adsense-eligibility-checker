 *  SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR PRICING AND ENTITLEMENTS
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Three monthly plans. Nothing here is a lifetime purchase: every
 *  allowance is per billing month and resets on the renewal date.
 *
 *  This file is the seed and the fallback. Admins can re-price plans
 *  and toggle features at runtime (see lib/plan-catalogue.ts), and
 *  those overrides live in the `plans` table — but the shape, the
 *  feature vocabulary, and the shipped defaults are defined here so a
 *  fresh database and an empty admin panel still produce a correct
 *  product.
 *
 *  `amountPaise` is authoritative and always in the smallest currency
 *  unit, because that is what a gateway charges (₹399 => 39900).
 *  Never store rupees as a float.
 *
 *  Two rules to keep in mind when editing:
 *
 *  1. A feature listed on a plan must be *enforced* somewhere. The
 *     mapping from feature to work is in lib/analysis/checks.ts and
 *     lib/analysis/engine.ts. A card line with nothing behind it is a
 *     lie told at the till.
 *  2. Higher tiers are cumulative. Pro's card only lists what Pro adds,
 *     but `features` below is the full effective set, because that is
 *     what the gate reads.
