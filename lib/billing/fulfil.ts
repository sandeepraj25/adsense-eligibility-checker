/**
 * The single place a payment turns into entitlement.
 *
 * Every gateway lands here, and so does every webhook, which is what
 * makes duplicate delivery harmless: the whole body runs inside one
 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, re-reads the payment row under that
 * write lock, and returns early if someone already fulfilled it. The
 * second caller therefore observes `already` instead of minting a second
 * subscription.
 *
 * Nothing about the caller is trusted. The plan, the price and the
 * currency all come from our own payment row; the gateway's reported
 * amount is only ever compared against it, never substituted for it.
