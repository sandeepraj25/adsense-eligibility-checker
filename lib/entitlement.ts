/**
 * Why this account cannot do a thing right now, or null if it can.
 *
 * Both the API routes and the pages read this, so the rules cannot drift
 * between what the UI promises and what the server permits. The order
 * matters — someone should be told the most specific true thing, so "your
 * account is suspended" beats "your plan expired" beats "you are out of
 * scans".
 *
 * Nothing here is a substitute for enforcement. lib/audit-service.ts
 * claims the quota in the database, and the feature gate in the analysis
 * engine decides what actually runs. This module explains; those two
 * refuse.
